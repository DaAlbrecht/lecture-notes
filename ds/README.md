# DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)

In this module, we had to implement different data Structures and Algorithms in either Python or Java.

I choose the lesser evilâ€¦ Python.

Additionally, out of fun, I tried to implement the same structure or algorithm in Rust, with the goal of having the same or a similar interface as in Python.
