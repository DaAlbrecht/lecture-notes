# DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)

In this module we had to implement different data Structures and Algorithms in either Python or Java.

I choose the lesser evil... Python.

Additionally out of fun i tried to implement the same structure or algorithm in Rust with the goal to have the same interface as in Python.

## Data Structures

- [x] Linked List 
 [Python (doubly linked list)](./lists/python/list.py) | [Rust linked list](./lists/rust/src/lib.rs)
